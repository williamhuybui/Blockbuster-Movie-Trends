This project is a part of the Data Science Cohort 082619 for [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com)

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
Microsoft sees other big companies getting into creating original video content, and want to get into the movie industry.  They hired us to help them understand the movie industry.

The purpose of this project is to collect data on movies that are doing the best in the box office, analyze that data, and give findings.  The goal is to explain those findings to a CEO through visualizations on the key factors that make a profitable box office movie.

## Project Description
The project was to get a data set from 2 sources to analyze and present our findings of what are the factors contributing to a profitable movie to Microsoft.  

We first started by deciding on what specific data we would be collecting.  Our data would consist of top 20 top-grossing movies each year from 2009 to 2019 and top 1000 actors according to IMDB.  Our decision in collecting this data set is due to the fact Microsoft is a Trillion dollar company.  Budget is not an issue and they are looking for the most profit.   The top 1000 actors we are using to analyze how important they are too profitable movies by their ranking.   We are hoping our data would give us a good sample size of what factors are required to make a profitable film.

For our data collection, we used themoviedb.org [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) for most of our data.  The secondary data source we web scraped [IMDB Top 1000 Actors and Actresses](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls058011111/?sort=list_order,asc&mode=detail&page=1&ref_=nmls_vm_dtl).

After collecting data we chose specific fields to analyze and imported that data into a CSV file. Data was then put into Tableau for further analysis and visualization.  From our analysis, we came up with recommendations that will benefit Microsoft as they move into the movie industry.
