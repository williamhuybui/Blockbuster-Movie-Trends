#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective

If you want to buy a house in Ames, Iowa , give me as much the details of your dream house as you can. I will give you the estimation of your house with a very high accuracy. (Top 7% on Kaggle at the time completed) 

### Technologies
* Visualization on Tableau
* Codes: on python, using pandas, numpy, sklearn, and other small libraries.

## Project Description
The 2010 data set is consist of 1461  house prices in Ames, Iowa. Each house has 79 features which almost describe all aspect of a house. The data can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) .

The executive presentation can be found in the powerpoint file

### Chalenges/Future work
It is hard to preprocess all 79 features without domain knowledge such as: what to fill in nan values, what to group by, what to exclude. 
The model can be recycled for a more updated version of the data. 
It would be more interesting to see how the listing price changes over time.
